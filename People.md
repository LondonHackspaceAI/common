(sorted alphabetically by last name)

* [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton) ([home page (toronto.edu)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/))

  British-born cognitive psychologist and computer scientist, most
  noted for his work on artificial neural networks. As of 2015 he
  divides his time working for Google and University of Toronto. He
  was one of the first researchers who demonstrated the use of
  generalized backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer
  neural nets.

  He co-invented [Boltzmann
  machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine) with
  Terry Sejnowski.

  His current main interest is in unsupervised learning procedures for
  neural networks with rich sensory input.[citation needed]


* [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) ([home page](http://www.andrewng.org/))

  Associate Professor at Stanford. Chairman and Co-Founder of
  Coursera, Chief Scientist at Baidu Research (in Silicon Valley,
  working on deep learning). Taught an online Machine Learning class
  that was offered to over 100,000 students, leading to the founding
  of Coursera (Stanford CS229 class, and CS229a hosted on ml-class.org
  in 2011.)

  Named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35
  innovators in the world under the age of 35.

  (Born in the UK, studies and residence in the USA.)

  In 2011, Ng founded the Google Brain project at Google, which
  developed very large scale artificial neural networks using Google's
  distributed computer infrastructure. Among its notable results
  was a neural network trained using deep learning algorithms on
  16,000 CPU cores, that learned to recognize higher-level concepts,
  such as cats, after watching only YouTube videos, and without ever
  having been told what a "cat" is.

* [Peter Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig) ([home page](http://www.norvig.com/))

  Co-author, with Stuart Russell, of [Artificial Intelligence: A
  Modern
  Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach),
  now the leading college text in the field.

  Was head of the Computational Sciences Division (now the Intelligent
  Systems Division) at NASA Ames Research Center. Is a Director of
  Research at Google Inc., and used to be its Director of Search
  Quality. Was chief designer at [Harlequin
  Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin_%28software_company%29)
  (former company working in the fields of AI and Lisp.)

  Has been an Assistant Professor at the University of Southern
  California and a Research Faculty Member at Berkeley.

  (One of the authors of JScheme.)

  One of the [two
  instructors](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271)
  of the "Intro to AI" course (Sebastian Thrun being the other, and
  main, one.)

* [Sebastian Thrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun)

  Innovator, entrepreneur educator, and computer scientist from
  Germany. He was CEO and cofounder of Udacity. Before that, he was a
  Google VP and Fellow, and a Professor of Computer Science at
  Stanford University.
