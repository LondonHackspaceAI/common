* [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) ([home page](http://www.andrewng.org/))

  Associate Professor at Stanford. Chairman and Co-Founder of
  Coursera, Chief Scientist at Baidu Research (in Silicon Valley,
  working on deep learning). Taught an online Machine Learning class
  that was offered to over 100,000 students, leading to the founding
  of Coursera (Stanford CS229 class, and CS229a hosted on ml-class.org
  in 2011.)

  Named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35
  innovators in the world under the age of 35.

  (Born in the UK, studies and residence in the USA.)

  In 2011, Ng founded the Google Brain project at Google, which
  developed very large scale artificial neural networks using Google's
  distributed computer infrastructure. Among its notable results
  was a neural network trained using deep learning algorithms on
  16,000 CPU cores, that learned to recognize higher-level concepts,
  such as cats, after watching only YouTube videos, and without ever
  having been told what a "cat" is.
