So using MapD as a personal system is an expensive use of resources, but when a system is architected and billed as an elastic, multitenant system, total cost of ownership for a team is less."; "If you really have a tight budget and need to use gamer cards as workstation cards (...), find yourself some aftermarket coolers, preferably liquid cooling.")
