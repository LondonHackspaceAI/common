# Algorithms

These are algorithms that we know exist and have some importance in
the field of AI or are related. We may not know details yet. This is
meant to serve us as a "mind map" for exploration. If you know an
answer, feel free to write it up in your page(s) in the
[users/](users/) area and link it from the term here (add something
like [Christian](users/Christian.md)). We may chose *not* to read
those pages right away though if we feel like finding out the answers
ourselves.


* regression
  * linear
  * general?

* Bayes
  * cs188 has some  as has intro to ai

* gradient descent
  * with differentiable functions?
  * stochastic gradient descent  (for one sample, randomly)
  * (step lengths)

* (logistic regression?)

* (choosing the cost function)

* hidden markov?

* tailor series

* Eigenvectors
