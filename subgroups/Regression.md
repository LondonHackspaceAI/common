# Subgroup Regression

(led by Christian)

We want to tackle these points from the [Algorithms](../Algorithms.md) page:

* regression
  * linear
  * general?
  * (logistic regression?)

## Possible courses to follow (from the [Teaching](Teaching.md) page)?

* "Intro to AI" (Stanford, Peter Norvig, Sebastian Thrun): <font color="green">**yes**</font> see [index](https://github.com/lorenzo-stoakes/stanford-ai/blob/master/index.md)

* "CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing" (Stanford, Richard Socher): [syllabus](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) (the course that Bob is working through) <font color="red">**no**</font>

* CS229a? Coursera: Machine Learning (Stanford, Andrew Ng): <font color="green">**yes**</font>, deals with linear then logistic regression in the [first 3 weeks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/#syllabus).

* [Computer Science 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/): according [index for fall '11](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa11/lectures.html) (which is not the same year!): <font color="red">**no**</font>

* [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) (Stanford, Fei-Fei Li, [Andrej Karpathy](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/), [Justin Johnson](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/)), [syllabus](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html): <font color="red">**no**</font>

* course by Geoffrey Hinton (see [People](People.md)), on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets): <font color="red">**no?**</font> (couldn't find syllabus, just watched intro, and checked [CSC321](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/) and [CSC2535](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/csc2535/lectures.html) linked from his home page)

* [Nando de Freitas](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/) has an AI course online: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/fXgYnCAcdTc): ? (TODO?)
