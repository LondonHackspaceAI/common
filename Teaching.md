* [Artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)

## Online books

* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)

* [Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.Online)

* [Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itila/p0.html)

## Online courses

*  "Intro to AI - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence": [www.ai-class.com](http://www.ai-class.com/), redirects to [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271) (Instructors: Peter Norvig, Sebastian Thrun)

  * [index](https://github.com/lorenzo-stoakes/stanford-ai/blob/master/index.md), 
    from [Course notes by some student](https://github.com/lorenzo-stoakes/stanford-ai).

  * [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnIJ7Ba5Sr4&index=1&list=PLE0157B77891C4FE8).

  * (The Stanford AI group also has [various other courses](http://ai.stanford.edu/courses/), by the way.)

* [Stanford University CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) (Instructor: Richard Socher) (Bob is working through that one)

    * Youtube has the 2015 videos
      [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsGC3XXF1ThHwtDo18d7WVw),
      but for this year's videos follow the "video" link at the individual
      sessions on the page linked above.

    * Bob so far has watched the first ~8 sessions from 2015, and one
      (TensorFlow) from 2016.

* [Coursera: Machine Learning (Stanford University)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) (Instructor: Andrew Ng (see [People](People.md), i.e. Stanford University course CS229a, correct?).

  * [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599)
  * The Stanford lectures are more thorough than those in Coursera.
  * [materials page](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html): some very good notes of Ng's

  Bob might be interested, looks steep.

* [CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/)
  ([Pieter Abbeel](https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/abbeel.html),
   [Dan Klein](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/)):

  * [new website?](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html), [index](http://ai.berkeley.edu/lecture_videos.html) ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11897766): "mostly focused on good old fashioned AI - things like tree/graph search, constraint satisfaction, logic, some basic graphical models, and a bit of RL/ML at the end". "CS188 vs Udacity's Intro to AI?"--"The Berkeley one is a bit slower and it has a statistics/probability refresher. I found it much easier to follow at 1.5x speed. I'd recommend the Udacity one if your stats/probability knowledge is fresh or if you're re-learning the topics. ")
  * [Youtube 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8twbs8SI4&list=PL-XXv-cvA_iA4YSaTMfF_K_wvrKAY2H8u)
  * [index for fall '11](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa11/lectures.html)

  Recommends [Russel, Norvig: AI: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) as accompanying book (but "this is not a course textbook, things are followed a bit different")

  Bob has been through the reinforcement learning bits. Thinks it's good.

* [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) (Stanford, Fei-Fei Li, [Andrej Karpathy](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/), [Justin Johnson](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/))

  * [syllabus](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)
  * [Youtube, Winter 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDB5ErpJCW0&index=5&list=PLlJy-eBtNFt6EuMxFYRiNRS07MCWN5UIA)

* course by [Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) (see [People](People.md))

  * [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets)
  * can't find syllabus

* [Nando de Freitas](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/) has an AI course online: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/fXgYnCAcdTc)

* [Udacity Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) basically an introduction to TensorFlow (see TensorFlow section in [NeuralNetworks](NeuralNetworks.md)).


### Technical

* [CS 179: GPU Programming](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs179/) (CUDA only, it seems) ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11902172))


### Lists

* [Awesome Courses](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses)

### For later

* [CS 281B (Berkeley): Statistical Learning Theory](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/281B-spring04/) ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11844884))


## Other online materials

* (James) This seems like it could be a nice introduction to neural networks: "Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch - An Introduction" [nn-from-scratch](https://github.com/dennybritz/nn-from-scratch/blob/master/nn-from-scratch.ipynb)

* (James) This drops you half way through chapter 1 if you're not a mathematician:  http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter1_Introduction/Chapter1.ipynb
Not recommended!

* Jake Vanderplas' talk at [PyCon on scikit-learn](https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_pycon2015). Github has some ipytyhon notebooks you can take whilst watching. Gives a nice intro to the package.
