# Teaching materials

## Wikipedia

* [Biological neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neural_network)

* [Artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)

## Online books

* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)

* [Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.Online)

* [Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itila/p0.html)

## Online courses

*  "Intro to AI - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence": [www.ai-class.com](http://www.ai-class.com/), redirects to [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271) (Instructors: Peter Norvig, Sebastian Thrun)

  * [index](https://github.com/lorenzo-stoakes/stanford-ai/blob/master/index.md), 
    from [Course notes by some student](https://github.com/lorenzo-stoakes/stanford-ai).

  * [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnIJ7Ba5Sr4&index=1&list=PLE0157B77891C4FE8).

  * (The Stanford AI group also has [various other courses](http://ai.stanford.edu/courses/), by the way.)

* [Stanford University CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) (Instructor: Richard Socher) (Bob is working through that one)

    * Youtube has the 2015 videos
      [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsGC3XXF1ThHwtDo18d7WVw),
      but for this year's videos follow the "video" link at the individual
      sessions on the page linked above.

    * Bob so far has watched the first ~8 sessions from 2015, and one
      (Tensorflow) from 2016.

* [Coursera: Machine Learning (Stanford University)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) (Instructor: Andrew Ng (see [People](People.md), i.e. Stanford University course CS229a, correct?)

  Bob might be interested, looks steep.

* [Computer Science 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/)
  ([Pieter Abbeel](https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/abbeel.html),
   [Dan Klein](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/)):
  [Youtube 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8twbs8SI4&list=PL-XXv-cvA_iA4YSaTMfF_K_wvrKAY2H8u)

  [index for fall '11](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa11/lectures.html)

  Recommends [Russel, Norvig: AI: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) as accompanying book (but "this is not a course textbook, things are followed a bit different")

  Bob has been through the reinforcement learning bits. Thinks it's good.

* [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) (Stanford, Fei-Fei Li, [Andrej Karpathy](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/), [Justin Johnson](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/))

  [syllabus](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)

  [Youtube, Winter 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDB5ErpJCW0&index=5&list=PLlJy-eBtNFt6EuMxFYRiNRS07MCWN5UIA)

* course by [Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) (see [People](People.md))

  * [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets)
  * can't find syllabus

* [Nando de Freitas](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/) has an AI course online: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/fXgYnCAcdTc)



### For later

[CS 281B (Berkeley): Statistical Learning Theory](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/281B-spring04/) ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11844884))


## Other online materials

* (James) This seems like it could be a nice introduction to neural networks: "Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch - An Introduction" [nn-from-scratch](https://github.com/dennybritz/nn-from-scratch/blob/master/nn-from-scratch.ipynb)

* (James) This drops you half way through chapter 1 if you're not a mathematician:  http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter1_Introduction/Chapter1.ipynb
Not recommended!
