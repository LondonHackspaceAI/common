## Wikipedia

* [Biological neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neural_network)

* [Artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)

## Online books

* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)

## Online courses

*  "Intro to AI - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence": [www.ai-class.com](http://www.ai-class.com/), redirects to [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271) (Instructors: Peter Norvig, Sebastian Thrun)

  * [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnIJ7Ba5Sr4&index=1&list=PLE0157B77891C4FE8).

  * [Course notes by some student](https://github.com/lorenzo-stoakes/stanford-ai).

  * (The Stanford AI group also has [various other courses](http://ai.stanford.edu/courses/), by the way.)


* [Stanford University CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) (Instructor: Richard Socher) (Bob is working through that one)

    * Youtube has the 2015 videos
      [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsGC3XXF1ThHwtDo18d7WVw),
      but for this year's videos follow the "video" link at the individual
      sessions on the page linked above.

    * Bob so far has watched the first ~8 sessions from 2015, and one
      (Tensorflow) from 2016.

* [Coursera: Machine Learning (Stanford University)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) (Instructor: Andrew Ng (see [People](People.md), i.e. Stanford University course CS229a, correct?)

  Bob might be interested, looks steep.

* [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Pieter Abbeel, Dan Klein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8twbs8SI4&list=PL-XXv-cvA_iA4YSaTMfF_K_wvrKAY2H8u)

  Bob has been through the reinforcement learning bits. Thinks it's good.

* [Stanford CS231n Winter 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDB5ErpJCW0&index=5&list=PLlJy-eBtNFt6EuMxFYRiNRS07MCWN5UIA)

### For later

[CS 281B (Berkeley): Statistical Learning Theory](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/281B-spring04/) ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11844884))


## Other online materials

* (James) This seems like it could be a nice introduction to neural networks: "Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch - An Introduction" [nn-from-scratch](https://github.com/dennybritz/nn-from-scratch/blob/master/nn-from-scratch.ipynb)

* (James) This drops you half way through chapter 1 if you're not a mathematician:  http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter1_Introduction/Chapter1.ipynb
Not recommended!
