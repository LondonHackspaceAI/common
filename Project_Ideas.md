# Project Ideas

Projects that we are considering working on.

## Christian

   * Email classification to sort an inbox into "important" and normal
mail without using Gmail; possibly extend it to filter spam more
reliably; understand the (theoretical and practical) differences
between Bayesian (usually employed for that purpose) and neural
network algorithms (which might allow to invest more CPU time to get
better precision)

   * Teach a neural network to draw logic conclusions. Similar to this?: [Neural Programmer-Interpreters](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~reedscot/iclr_project.html) / [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06279) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11617971)

## Sam

   * see whether AI can help find 'patterns' in genome data, or music

## Tony

   * evaluate data from commoncrawl.org
